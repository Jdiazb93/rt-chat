# rt-chat
Real Time chat, generated with NextJS, NodeJS, Express and WebSocket

# Instructions

First we need to install the dependencies.

We need to enter on server folder and run

```bash
npm i
```

And then we go to client folder and run the same command

```bash
npm i
```

After this, we need to run both services.

go to server folder and run

```bash
npm run start
```

and to run the client, we need to go to client folder and run

```bash
npm run dev
```

# To use the app

After that we are running both services, we can go to the [APP](http://localhost:3000) <--- Client

and we need to Login with our google account.

After that, we are redirected to the live chat.

On the live chat we can send all of the messages that we want, and every user connected can see the message.

# How to test

You can open this app on 2 browsers at the same time and login with different accounts.

And when you send a message from any of those accounts, you can see the message on both chats.
